If you need to change some css of JTouch, just rename this folder from '-customize' to 'customize',
and then add your css code to /customize/mytheme.css, remeber to remove all css code on 
this file before you copy or create new css.

JTouch then can understand that you have your own css, and include it to html output without require any hack to the template.
